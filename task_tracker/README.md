# task_tracker

A task tracking Flutter application

The design of this Flutter application comes from a design made by [tubik](https://tubikstudio.com/)
for their _Task Tracker_ project.

> I am **NOT** in any way affiliated with tubik. I simply liked their design and wanted to implement
it as a learning experience. 

## Designs

The original designs on Dribbble from which I made this application are:
